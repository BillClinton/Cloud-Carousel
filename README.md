## Installing

### Get The Spark

If you have the Spark Manager installed, type:

```php tools/spark install cloud-carousel``` (Linux or OSX)

or

```php tools\spark install cloud-carousel``` (Windows)


#### Copy Resources Directory
Copy the resources directory to your application directory so your application's
directory structure looks like this: 
```
   .
   |-application
   |-resources
     index.php
```

The files in the resources directory contain required javacript and css files.  If you put them somewhere else, 
make sure to update the cloud-carousel.php config file.
